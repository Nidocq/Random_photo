# Watch Random Photos on Prnt.sc

prnt.sc uses very weak hex encoding to post their photos to the web. Therefore we can access some of the pictures taken by inserting a random hex code into the url

This process is automated with simple Bash Script

It will open your browser and continuously open new tabs with a new photo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nidocq/Random_photo.git

cd random_photo
chmod +x random_photo.sh
./random_photo.sh 

```

**To stop the script again press: Ctrl + C**

Enjoy random photos :)
